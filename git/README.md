# 📘 Git Journey

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey with Git.  
In this project, I practiced essential Git commands, branching strategies, merging, rebasing, and working with remote repositories.

The goal of this project was to understand how Git works in real-world development environments.

---

# 🚀 What I Learned

## 1️⃣ Git Initialization

- Created a new project folder  
- Initialized a Git repository using:

```bash
git init
```

- Checked repository status using:

```bash
git status
```

---

## 2️⃣ Creating Files & Folders

- Created folders using:

```bash
mkdir folder_name
```

- Created files using:

```bash
touch file.txt
```

- Added content using:

```bash
echo "content" > file.txt
```

- Understood that Git does not track empty folders.

---

## 3️⃣ Staging & Committing

- Added files to staging area:

```bash
git add .
```

- Committed changes:

```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```

- Learned about:
  - Working directory  
  - Staging area  
  - Repository  

---

## 4️⃣ Branching

- Created feature branches:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch-name
```

- Switched branches:

```bash
git checkout branch-name
```

- Checked available branches:

```bash
git branch
```

Understood why feature branches are important in real projects.

---

## 5️⃣ Merging

- Merged feature branch into main:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

- Learned:
  - How merge combines branch history  
  - What a merge commit is  

---

## 6️⃣ Rebasing

- Rebased feature branch onto main:

```bash
git rebase main
```

Learned:
- Difference between merge and rebase  
- How rebase creates a cleaner commit history  
- How history changes after rebasing  

---

## 7️⃣ Handling Merge Conflicts

- Created conflict intentionally  
- Resolved conflicts manually  
- Completed merge after resolving  

Learned:
- What conflict markers look like  
- How to fix conflicts safely  

---

# 🧠 Key Concepts I Understand Now

- Git tracks changes, not files  
- Commits are snapshots  
- Branches are pointers  
- Merge vs Rebase difference  
- Local vs Remote repository  
- Staging area purpose  
- How real-world teams collaborate using Git  

---

# 📊 Commands Practiced

- git init  
- git status  
- git add  
- git commit  
- git branch  
- git checkout  
- git merge  
- git rebase  
- git log  
- git remote  
- git push  
- git pull
